    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "now that we have seen the key map and reduce operators in spark, and also know when to use transformation and action operators, we can revisit the word count problem we introduced earlier in the section. In this lab, we will use the methods seen in the coding labs to read a text corpus into spark environment, perform a word count and try basic NLP ideas to get a good grip on how MapReduce performs. \n",

    "Note: In your Pyspark environment, create a folder `data` and move all the files from the provided `data` folder into it. Jupyter interface doesnt allow moving complete folders. \n",

    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe Map-Reduce operation in a big data context\n",
    "* Perform basic NLP tasks with a given text corpus\n",
    "* Perform basic analysis from the experiment findings towards identifying writing styles\n",

    "We will illustrate a MapReduce computation for counting the number of occurrences for each word in a text corpus. In this example, the input file is a repository of documents, and each document is an element. We shall count the frequency of stop words for __style identification__ as stop words might have unique features which can potentially describe author's writing style based on their use of stop words while writing. We shall look at some texts by Shakspeare and Jane Austin following this motivation. \n",
